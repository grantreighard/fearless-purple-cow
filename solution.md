# Solution:

## Steps taken
1. Removed `create-react-app` scaffold code.
2. Created `purpleCow.js` as a functional component.
3. Added `PurpleCow `component to App.js.
4. Added a `count` variable to the state with hooks.
5. Added title, button, and conditional count display.
6. Added `axios` via npm.
7. Hit my endpoint at `api.countapi.xyz` with axios using a unique domain and my key, then set the count with the counter value.
8. Added a fun way to display the count.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo to your computer.
2. Run `npm i` in the root directory.
3. Run `npm start` in the root directory. The web application will open in your default browser.
4. Click the button to get the count and display it.

# Future updates and changes:
- I would like to add more styling to make the presentation even nicer.
- A way to reset the count would be nice. I see there is a way to do it in the documentation, but I got a 403 Forbidden when I attempted it.
